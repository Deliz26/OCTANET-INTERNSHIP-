# OCTANET-INTERNSHIP-
# ATM Machine Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates an ATM machine with basic functionalities such as account balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, cash deposit, PIN change, and transaction history. The simulation is designed to mimic the operations of a real ATM, providing users with a simple and interactive experience.

## Features
- Account Balance Inquiry
- Cash Withdrawal
- Cash Deposit
- PIN Change
- Transaction History
